Project DescriptionðŸŽ‰âœ¨:
        This Project consist of 4 different assignments(each a mini-project) in the Jupyter File Notebook attached above.They are Natural Language Processing,Text Generation,Prompt Engineering and Data Analysis Projects.Each and every project is documented in a good manner in the notebook file itself.So here in readme I have given a basic idealogy about what the Jupyter notebook consist of.I have added comments for functions used and have also added comments for line by line execution in some cases.Each Assignment has a clear explanation from start to the end.I have provided each Projects with Aim,Procedure and Result in the Notebook itself.So kindly take a look of my notebook file attached to get a clear idea.Since I have did a very good documentation there,I believe this readme is more than enough to give a gist about my Project's notebook file.
